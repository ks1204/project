# Wick Career Django Project

1. Allows users to fill out a form to register themselves. The form should ask for a userâ€™s
first name, last name, e-mail address, password, and a URL for their personal web site.
All form fields are required. The e-mail address and URL should be validated to make
sure they have the correct format.
2. Stores or persists this form data in a MySQL table upon form submission. Feel free to
create a database for your application for this purpose as you see fit.
3. Allows users to login with their e-mail and password. Upon logging in, users should see a
UI (i.e. landing page) displaying a welcome message containing their first and last name.
4. Allows users to logout. Upon logging out, users should see a UI (i.e. logout confirmation
page) confirming they are logged out and with a link allowing them to login again.
5. Allows admins to manage (add, edit, delete) all users via a UI. Feel free to design the UI
as you see fit.
